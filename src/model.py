UNET(nn.Module)

This is a PyTorch implementation of the U-Net architecture, widely used for image segmentation tasks.

🧠 Overview:
- Composed of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder)
- Skip connections are used to concatenate high-resolution features from the encoder to the decoder
- Particularly effective for biomedical image segmentation and tasks requiring precise localization

🔧 Parameters:
- in_channels (int): Number of input channels (e.g., 1 for grayscale images, 3 for RGB)
- out_channels (int): Number of output channels (e.g., 1 for binary segmentation)
- features (list[int]): List of feature map sizes for each encoder level (default: [64, 128, 256, 512])

🧱 Components:
- `DoubleConv`: A building block composed of two convolutional layers (3x3), each followed by BatchNorm and ReLU activation
- `MaxPool2d`: Reduces the spatial resolution by half at each encoder step
- `ConvTranspose2d`: Performs upsampling in the decoder path
- `final_conv`: A 1x1 convolution that reduces the final feature map to the desired number of output channels

⚙️ Forward Pass:
- The input is passed through a sequence of `DoubleConv` blocks and downsampled using max pooling
- Features are stored at each encoder level for skip connections
- A bottleneck block processes the deepest features
- Decoder upsamples the features using `ConvTranspose2d` and concatenates them with corresponding skip connections
- Final output is generated with a 1x1 convolution, preserving the original spatial dimensions

📈 Output:
- Returns a segmentation map of shape `(batch_size, out_channels, height, width)`

class DoubleConv(nn.Module):
"""
DoubleConv(nn.Module)

This class defines a basic building block used in U-Net architectures: two consecutive convolutional layers,
each followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation function.

📌 Purpose:
- Extract and refine spatial features in an image
- Used in both the encoder and decoder parts of U-Net

🔧 Parameters:
- in_channels (int): Number of input channels (e.g., 1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)
- out_channels (int): Number of output channels produced by the block

🧠 Architecture:
- Two 2D convolution layers (3x3 kernel, stride=1, padding=1, no bias)
- Each followed by BatchNorm2d and ReLU activation
- Preserves spatial dimensions (height and width)

🌀 Forward Pass:
- Takes an input tensor of shape (B, in_channels, H, W)
- Returns a tensor of shape (B, out_channels, H, W)

✅ Example:
  block = DoubleConv(1, 64)
  out = block(input_tensor)

def create_model(config):
"""
create_model(config: dict) -> Tuple[torch.nn.Module, torch.nn.Module, torch.optim.Optimizer]

Initializes a U-Net++ segmentation model using `segmentation_models_pytorch`, along with the
binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

📌 Purpose:
- Create a ready-to-train segmentation model with preconfigured architecture, loss, and optimizer

🔧 Parameters:
- config (dict): Dictionary containing configuration options. Required keys:
    - 'encoder': name of the encoder (e.g., 'resnet34', 'efficientnet-b0', etc.)
    - 'weights': pretrained weights for the encoder (e.g., 'imagenet')
    - 'lr': learning rate (float)

🚀 Returns:
- model (torch.nn.Module): U-Net++ model instance
- loss (torch.nn.Module): Binary cross-entropy loss with logits (BCEWithLogitsLoss)
- optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): Adam optimizer for the model's parameters

🖥️ Device:
- Automatically uses GPU if available; falls back to CPU otherwise

🧠 Notes:
- Input images are assumed to have 1 channel
- Output is a single-channel mask (binary segmentation)
- Activation is set to `None` because the final activation (sigmoid) is usually applied during inference

✅ Example:
  model, loss_fn, optimizer = create_model(config)

def test():
"""test()

Performs a simple forward pass through the U-Net model to verify that it runs without errors.

📌 Purpose:
- Check whether the UNET model is correctly defined and can process a sample input
- Useful for debugging model architecture or tensor shape mismatches

🚀 What it does:
- Creates a dummy input tensor of shape (1, 1, 161, 161), simulating a single grayscale image
- Initializes a U-Net model with 1 input and 1 output channel
- Passes the input through the model to ensure it produces an output without errors

⚠️ Note:
- This is not a unit test with assertions. It's a basic smoke test to ensure forward propagation works.

✅ Example usage:
